# Let's throw some shade

Here's a color spread representing the `default` color:

---

<div className="space-y-4">
  <ColorSpread color="default" />
</div>

---

Below, I'll add three more color spread. Those all have the `primary` color assigned to them. Each spread also has a different `data-theme` attribute value.

As you can see, right now we only see the `500` shade for these. And it makes sense - our `primary` color is only that `500` value for now!

<div className="space-y-4">
  <ColorSpread data-theme="default" color="primary" />
  <ColorSpread data-theme="rainforest" color="primary" />
  <ColorSpread data-theme="candy" color="primary" />
</div>

## Your challenge

Repeat the process we've done in the first challenge, so that we have complete color spreads (`50 - 900`) for each theme!

Don't worry about repetitive code for now, we'll take care of that later. It's fine to copy and paste stuff!

You don't have to touch the markup. The `ColorSpread` component will iterate over each color shade and output a color tile for it. All you need to do is wire up the new themable colors.

Good luck!
