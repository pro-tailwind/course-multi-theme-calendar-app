# Make everything uppercase!

Let's create a new Taliiwnd CSS plugin. As a "hello world" exercise so start with, make this plugin do one thing: MAKE EVERYTHING UPPERCASE!

As you've gotten used to by now, don't touch any markup anywhere. Make it happen by creating your plugin and registering it in the Tailwind config file.

While you could write that code anywhere, I've created an empty `multi-theme-plugin.js` file in the `/workshop` directory. Go ahead and use that file to create your plugin!

Good luck!
