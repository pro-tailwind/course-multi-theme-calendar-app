import { MarkdownWrapper } from '../../../workshop/components/markdown-wrapper'
import { ColorSpread } from '../../../workshop/components/color-spread'

export default function ({ children }) {
  return <MarkdownWrapper>{children}</MarkdownWrapper>
}

# Let's collocate our code

// TODO

1. Move the CSS variable definitions to the plugin
2. Move the theme color extension to the plugin

Again, don't worry about code duplication just yet. We can do all sorts of cool things with JavaScript, but let's first make sure our functionality is ported over.

<div className="space-y-4">
  <ColorSpread data-theme="default" color="primary" />
  <ColorSpread data-theme="rainforest" color="primary" />
  <ColorSpread data-theme="candy" color="primary" />
</div>
