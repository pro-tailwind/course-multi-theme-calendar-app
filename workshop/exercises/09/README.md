Nice - all our functionality comes from the plugin now, and it seems to work quite well!

Plot twist: there are actually a few issues with it. And a great way to expose those is to start using our plugin in the actual Booking UI App!

# Exercise

Open the `components/background-decoration.jsx` component, and make it use our new `primary` theme colors exclusively!

To test the different color themes, add a `data-theme` attribute to the parentmost element on that component, and try out your different theme names.

What issues did this expose with our theming approach? Do you understand why this problem is happening?
