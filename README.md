# Multi-Theme Strategy in Tailwind CSS - Playground App

Welcome to this Pro Tailwind workshop!

This app is similar to the [Calendar App](https://calendar-app.protailwind.com), but the theming part of it has been stripped out and "prepared" to be implemented.

There is no need to clone this app on your local machine for the workshop - but you can if you want.

We'll use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) during the workshop, to make working on the project a one-click affair.

## Building our plugin in Tailwind Play

In this workshop, we'll build a Tailwind CSS plugin that brings support for multiple color themes to any project using Tailwind.

We'll do most of our work in a series of Tailwind Play challenges, but at some point we'll test our code again this Playground App.

The workshop has its own website: https://theming.protailwind.com

### Focus groups & breakout rooms

You'll be split in small focus groups for today's workshop challenges. This consists of separate "breakout rooms", where each member of the group will take turns "driving" a challenge by sharing their screen.

The groups will remain the same for the entire workshop.

At the end of challenges, we'll all come back together to discuss. "Pairing" in small groups and actively participating to group discusions are key to this workshop. They'll help you maximise your learning experience.

I really encourage everyone to participate actively, ask questions, and of course be supportive of one another!

### Aaaand... who am I?

I'm Simon, your workshop instructor. ðŸ‘‹

If you've watched some YouTube videos from the Tailwind Labs channel, you've most probably seen my face already!

I love utility-first CSS. I've been supporting and promoting this styling approach even before Tailwind CSS existed! I'm a front-end developer, designer and content creator.

I bring a lot of enthusiasm and positive energy in everything I do, this is just how I'm wired up!

I have been teaching in-person workshops for multiple senior engineering teams, and a constant piece of feedback I get is my workshops are exciting, fun and engaging. To me, that's the best way to learn!

I sometimes speak at conferences and meetups. I make YouTube videos and I'm also an instructor on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

You can connect with me on Twitter, I'm [simonswiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

I'm super excited to dive into this workshop with you.
